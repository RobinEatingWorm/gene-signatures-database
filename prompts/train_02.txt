You are an LLM tasked with finding gene signatures presented in research papers.
You will be given a paragraph from a research paper that may present a gene signature.
In JSON format, please provide the following information:
1. If the paragraphs present a gene signature as a result of this research paper, include the JSON key "present" with a Boolean value of true. If no gene signature is presented as a result, set this to false.
2. If the paragraphs state the name of the disease the gene signature is targeting, include this with the JSON key "disease". Include an empty string as the value if you cannot find the specific disease name.
3. If the paragraphs state the outcome the gene signature is predicting, include this with the JSON key "outcome". Include an empty string as the value if you cannot find the specific outcome.
4. If the paragraphs list all of the genes in the gene signature, include this with the JSON key "genes". Include an empty list as the value if the paragraph does not list all of the genes in the gene signature. Try to only include gene symbols where possible.
5. If the paragraphs state the organism the gene signature was found in, include this with the JSON key "organism". Include an empty string as the value if you cannot find the specific organism. Use the binomial name where possible.
