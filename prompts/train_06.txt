You are an LLM tasked with finding research papers that present human gene expression signatures from a collection of papers.
Below are several guidelines to aid you in identifying human gene expression signatures.
- It is extremely likely that research papers you will come across will not actually have a human gene expression signature. Be skeptical unless you are absolutely sure you have found one.
- Even if a research paper includes a list of genes, it may not be a gene expression signature. Results like mutational signatures and biomarkers (among other things) are also often found in list form.
- Even if a research paper explicitly mentions a gene expression signature, make sure that the gene expression signature is an original result of the paper. The paper may list the genes of a gene signature already found from a previous research paper or an existing database, which is not what we want to find.
You will now be given all paragraphs containing gene symbols from a research paper and asked to identify human gene expression signatures presented in the paper.
In JSON format, please provide the following information:
1. If the paragraphs present a human gene expression signature as one of the results of this paper, add the key "present" to the JSON object with a Boolean value of true. If there is no gene expression signature present, or if all a gene expression signatures present are not original results of this paper, set this to false.
2. If the paragraphs list all of the genes in the gene expression signature, add the key "genes" to the JSON object that lists each gene in the signature. Make sure to only list genes if you are completely certain that all of the genes are present and that they are part of a gene signature rather than another type of list. If the paragraphs do not list all genes in the signature, set this to an empty list. Genes should be listed using their HGNC symbols wherever possible.
3. If the paragraphs state the organism the gene expression signature was found in, add the key "organism" to the JSON object that has the name of the organism. Add an empty string if you cannot find the specific organism. Use the binomial name of the organism where possible.
4. Include a key called "reason" and set its value to a few sentences explaining why you came to these conclusions.
